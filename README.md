# üñºÔ∏è Picture to HTML with Gemini API (n8n + Custom UI)

This project is an **automation flow** built on **n8n**, combined with a **custom frontend UI**.  
The UI allows users to **upload an image**, which is then sent via **Webhook** to the n8n workflow.  
Using **Google Gemini API**, the image is processed and converted into **HTML code**.  
The generated HTML can be previewed directly in the browser.
